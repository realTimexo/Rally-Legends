**This project is a realistic rally game for passionate drivers – built with great attention to detail and a strong focus on immersive and intense driving experiences.**

Description
=====

The game is made up of several core components that work together to create an authentic rally racing experience:

* **Driving Physics:** A sophisticated simulation engine models traction, weight transfer, drifting, and grip depending on surface type (gravel, asphalt, snow, mud).
* **Dynamic Weather & Time:** Weather effects like rain, fog, and thunderstorms combined with day-night transitions impact visibility and control.
* **Track System:** A variety of handcrafted rally stages inspired by real-world events, featuring jumps, tight corners, and dangerous climbs.
* **Vehicle Modeling:** Highly detailed rally cars with a full damage system, immersive sound design, and particle systems for realistic feedback in every situation.
* **Interface & Setup:** Intuitive menus, adjustable car setups, and optional driving assists tailored to both newcomers and veterans.
